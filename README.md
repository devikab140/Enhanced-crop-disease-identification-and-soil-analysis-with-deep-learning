# Enhanced-crop-disease-identification-and-soil-analysis-with-deep-learning


A deep learning-powered system that detects rice crop diseases and analyzes soil parameters for smarter farming decisions.

##  Key Features

-  **Disease Detection**  
  Classifies rice leaf conditions into **Blast**, **Blight**, **Tungro**, and **Healthy** using EfficientNetB0.

-  **Soil Analysis**  
  Analyzes environmental data (moisture, temperature, humidity, wind speed) to assess crop health risks.

-  **Multi-Modal Fusion**  
  Fuses image-based predictions with environmental features for improved accuracy.

-  **Real-time Monitoring**  
  Supports deployment in mobile/web apps for live farmer support.

##  Tech Stack

- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- EfficientNetB0 for image classification
- Dense Neural Network for sensor data
- Multi-modal data fusion architecture

##  Outcomes

- Increased prediction accuracy using combined data sources  
- Early disease detection and smart alerts for better crop management  
- Scalable architecture for real-world agricultural deployment
